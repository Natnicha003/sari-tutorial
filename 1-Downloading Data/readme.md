# Downloading Data

*All the data in this tutorial has been downloaded for you*. 

We will reference the below sites through the tutorial to illustrate how students can obtain similar data to the tutorials.

We will be focusing on SAR data from [ALOS-1](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/alos/), a satellite that was active from 2007-2010. We will also briefly discuss how to incorporate optical images from Landsat and Sentinel-2.

There are several open data repositories to download the related data.
